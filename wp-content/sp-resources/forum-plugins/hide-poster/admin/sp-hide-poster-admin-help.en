<strong>Hide Poster Info</strong><br /><br />
By setting this option, you can by default have the enable hide poster info option checked on the new topic form. This will only be applicable if the current
forum has enabled hide post info.  With this option enabled, you can still turn it off for specific topics by unchecking the option on the new topic form.
