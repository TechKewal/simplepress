<strong>Post Threading</strong><br /><br />
You set the number here of how many levels of threading you wish to allow.<br><br>
The <b>default</b> is 5<br>
The <b>maximum</b> is 10<br><br>
How many levels you choose has as much to do with display space as anything else -
along with the practicality of so many indented posts.
