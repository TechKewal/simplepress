This project is an extension designed to run on the Simple:Press Wordpress Plugin Platform.  

### How do I get set up? ###

This plugin is not a normal WordPress plugin and cannot be installed via the WordPress PLUGINS screen.
Instead, you should:

- Download the plugin file from your receipt or from your dashboard
- Go to FORUM->Plugins
- click on `Plugin Uploader`
- Click on the `Choose File` button and select the zip file you downloaded earlier
- Click the `Upload Now` button
- Go back to the FORUM->Plugins screen and activate the plugin.

NOTE: This plugin will show any languages that you have installed in the Simple Press Languages folder.
To get a site fully translated you will want to download the core, theme and plugin translations as all are used on the front end.
You can get available translations from our Simple Press translation site at http://glotpress.simple-press.com/glotpress/
More information can be found at: https://simple-press.com/documentation/installation/installation-information/localization/
Do not change the WPLANG constant for this plugin unless you want your whole site in that language.
Selecting the Site Default will give users the language set by WPLANG.
