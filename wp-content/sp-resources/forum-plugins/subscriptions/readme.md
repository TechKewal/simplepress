This project is an extension designed to run on the Simple:Press Wordpress Plugin Platform.

Instead, you should:

- Download the file from your receipt or from your dashboard(subscriptions.zip).
- Go to FORUM->Plugins
- click on `Plugin Uploader`
- Click on the `Choose File` button and select the zip file you downloaded earlier
- Click the `Upload Now` button
- Go back to the FORUM->Plugins screen and activate the plugin.
