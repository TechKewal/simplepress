<strong>Post Multiple Options</strong><br /><br />
In this admin panel, you can optionally configure which forums you want to include in the list of possible forums to allow the cross posting in.<br /><br />
This is a global, alternate way to controlling which forums can get cross postings. More importantly, if there is a standard set of forums you want to cross post
in, this allows you to cut down the noise and amount of forums listed if you have many forums and some will not get cross postings.<br /><br />
If you want to leave it possible for all forums to receive cross postings, then just leave all forums unchecked.
