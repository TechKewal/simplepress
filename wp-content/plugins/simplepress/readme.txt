The most versatile and feature-rich forum plugin for WordPress. Create unlimited forums with awesome features directly in your WordPress site.

== Description ==
Simple:Press brings enterprise class forum capabilities to your WordPress site.  It makes it easy to get your forum started with additional powerful features available as you need them.

Built for performance with custom tables, it is tightly integrated into WordPress's user and security model and can easily scale up to thousands of users.

Unlike other Forum plugins, all of Simple:Press's features are built and supported by one organization - no need to contact multiple vendors when you need support for a feature!

And Simple:Press has hundreds of features!  Between the free functions and premium add-ons we likely have just about every feature you might need.

From multi-level forum structures to post threading and private messages, chances are that if you need a feature we have already built it.  13+ years of development has exposed us to all kinds of customer requirements and has helped us build a rock-solid product!

Go premium! A premium bundle of our add-ons will super-charge your forum! [Simple-Press Pricing Options](https://simple-press.com/pricing/)!

4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Setup =

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, you now need to run through a set-up process.  This creates the tables and default data that the plugin requires.
You can access this setup process by either clicking the INSTALL button that should be visible at the top of the admin pages or by going to FORUM->INSTALL.

At the conclusion of a successful install, a button will be displayed to load the forum admin and clicking on this will take you to the Storage Locations panel. All being well, all locations will be ticked as created and available but if this is not the case follow the instructions to manually create folders if necessary.

= Getting Started =
Now that you have installed your forums read our [getting started](https://simple-press.com/documentation/getting-started/) pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've installed the plugin - now what? =

Now that you have installed your forums read our [getting started](https://simple-press.com/documentation/getting-started/) pages.

= I don't receive e-mail notifications =

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. The best thing you can do to diagnose email delivery issues is to install a plugin that shows you an email log.  We recommend MAILGUN or SMTP POST.  The logs will let you know if emails are being generated and not delivered or just not being generated at all.
