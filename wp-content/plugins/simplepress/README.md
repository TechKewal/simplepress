# Simple:Press WordPress Forum Plugin
Simple:Press is the most feature-rich free forum plugin for WordPress. It was initially released when WordPress was just 3 years old and and has been under continuous development since then for over 12 years!
As of Jan 2019, it is available here on Github.

## Requirements

- WordPress 4.9+
- PHP 5.6+

## Installation

To get started right away, just download the fully built plugin from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simplepress)

For development, you can just edit the files directly.  
There is no extensive or complicated build process required.  However, you do have to minify the JS and CSS files when not running in debug mode, but that's it!

### Dependencies

None - all files are checked into the repository.

## Contributing

To contribute, just fork the DEV branch and then submit a PR with your changes.
